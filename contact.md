## What you can expect from us:
1. We will set up an initial Zoom meeting with you to better understand your story. This initial meeting is 100% free of charge, and we will be upfront and transparent with you as to whether or not we will be able to help you with your needs.
2. For some, we may decide to schedule a series of personalized mentoring sessions, with no further services being necessary. For others, we may arrive at an opportunity to collaborate on a creative project, whether that be through arts, media, and beyond.
3. In both of these cases, any further pricing for our services will be discussed and clearly laid out during the initial meeting, and quotes will vary on a case by case basis.

## What we will expect from you in return:
1. An open heart and an open mind.
2. Respect for our time and our efforts.
3. Patience and optimism â˜º
