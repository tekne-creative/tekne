## We are a mother and son team that faces challenges with thoughtfulness and heart.

In our chaotic world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to have a clear vision for what we want in life. Many of us are just looking for a way forward while also maintaining a healthy state of mind. At Tekne, we strongly believe that *everyone* has the creative potential necessary to find their own resolve, and we are here to help you get there.

### <b> Our approach: turn your challenge into a creative project. Here are some examples: </b>

- Looking to commemorate an important milestone in your life, but not sure where to start?
    - We can help turn your appreciation and ideas into a well-crafted film that you can share with your friends and loved ones.
    - Or, we can work with you to put together a personalized concert for the occasion â€“ a lasting and precious memory.
- Struggling to find a career that makes the most of your talents and interests? Have a concern about how to prepare yourself or your loved ones for an uncertain future?
    - Sit down with us for a mentorship session and we can help you figure out what matters most to you, and how to get there.
    - Or, meet with us for a guided photography session, where we nurture and develop your vision of your future as we work together on creating a series of photos that you can truly call your own.

<b> What others see as obstacles, we see as oppportunities to create something new. </b> We have experience implementing our approach across a wide variety of fields ranging from healthcare, the arts, academia, and beyond, and we are always on the lookout for more opportunities to collaborate with others and make something truly special.
