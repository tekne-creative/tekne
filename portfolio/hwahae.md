## Reconciliation

화해 "Reconciliation", a string trio, was written for the 2015 Sejong Prize for Music Composition. The Korean phrase “hwahae” (화해) has a meaning which is akin to the word reconciliation. However, 화해 carries a much deeper meaning – it is a sense of forgiveness between or among one another – not just one, but both parties resolve to make amends and break former tensions which once pushed them apart. This music makes use of visceral Korean folk themes to explore the art of conflict: how it begins, how it escalates, how it shapes and is shaped by human actions, and how, even if seemingly unimaginable, resolution can be achieved.
