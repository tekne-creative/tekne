## Tribulation of Courage and Conscience

勇敢に立ち向かう(yūkan ni tachimukau) is a poetic Japanese phrase that expresses the purest spirit of bravery: having the resolve to walk forth even if the world is against you. This music portrays the incredible story of Chiune Sugihara, a former Japanese consul in Lithuania during the Holocaust. He chose to adamantly follow his conscience in the direst of circumstances, selflessly saving thousands of Jews and nearly losing everything he had in the process.

勇敢に立ち向かう was a finalist in the 2018 ASCAP Morton Gould awards.
