With the help of Tania Manago, Assistant Director of Patient Experience, we delivered live personalized violin concerts to patients on the stroke unit at Clara Maass Medical Center in 2021. We found that the experience was able to help patients and healthcare providers connect and bond over a musical experience, and that it helped relieve stress for patients and healthcare workers alike.
