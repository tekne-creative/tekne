This piece was originally written in the wake of the tragic deaths of Nika and Michaela Kholodenko. In 2022, musicians from Virtual Bedside Concerts created an excerpted recording of the piece as a musical tribute in response to violent tragedy, standing in solidarity with the victims of all shootings and gun violence.
