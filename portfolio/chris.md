Previously, as a student who was struggling with personal issues, navigating the complexities of life, and overcoming the COVID pandemic, I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work with Eva from Tekne. Eva was an incredible mentor who provided me with the most amazing life advice. Her guidance and support were invaluable to me, and I am truly grateful for her presence in my life.

Throughout our meaningful sessions, Eva demonstrated an exceptional level of empathy, understanding, and patience. She listened to me without judgment, and always offered me practical, constructive advice that was tailored to my specific needs and circumstances. She helped me to see things from a different perspective and encouraged me to explore new ways of thinking.

One of the things that stood out to me the most about Eva was her unwavering commitment to my wellbeing. She truly cared about my success and happiness, and always went above and beyond to ensure that I was equipped with the tools and resources I needed to thrive. Whether it was recommending a helpful book or providing me with a useful exercise, she was there to point me in the right direction.

Thanks to Eva's incredible life advice, I was able to overcome many of the challenges I was facing and achieve my goals. Her guidance and support were absolutely instrumental in my personal, academic and career growth. I would definitely recommend a Tekne mentoring session to anyone looking for a skilled and compassionate life advisor who truly cares about you.
