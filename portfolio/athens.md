## Just Another Day at the Coffee Shop?

This was a looped audio installation created as part of *Polykatoikia*: the Columbia University 2019 Athens Curatorial Project exhibition in collaboration with a professional art studio in Athens, "3 137". The exhibition explored the development and repurposing of culture in everyday human forms across Greece.

*Just Another Day at the Coffee Shop* explores the definition of "culture" by examining how Greek people view their own deeply-rooted culture and history, prompting listeners to reflect on what their own cultural values really mean to them.
