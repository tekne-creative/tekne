Virtual Bedside Concerts was established in April of 2020 at Harvard Medical School (in collaboration with Project Music Heals Us and the Massachusetts General Hospital Happiness Committee) to remotely connect patients with musicians to combat loneliness, anxiety, and distress. I have had the pleasure of working with Jason from Tekne as a fellow Co-Director of this organization for the past two years, and I have seen his creativity, expertise, and resilience firsthand.

As Co-Director of Virtual Bedside Concerts, Jason has exhibited unparalleled talent for problem-solving and excellent organizational skills. He constantly strives for excellence, bringing new ideas to each meeting for improving the program and implementing changes efficiently. He obtains and acts upon feedback in a timely manner. He coordinates between and communicates effectively with our healthcare professionals, musicians, and patients, ensuring that every concert runs smoothly.

In addition to his leadership skills, Jason is also a conservatory-level violinist with a unique talent for connecting with the people he works with. Several patients have reached out to us after Jason's concerts highlighting how their interactions with him have been incredibly meaningful and impactful. These experiences range from postoperative encounters at Brigham and Women’s Hospital to weekly group concerts for veterans at Mount Holyoke Soldier’s Home.

I believe that Jason can serve as an excellent advisor to individuals and teams facing creative challenges of any kind. Particularly with regard to growing projects at the crossroads of music and medicine, I cannot recommend Jason more highly.
